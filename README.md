Welcome to the **Prediction of Breast Cancer Incidence** project repository! This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection. By analyzing two distinct datasetsâ€” the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset** and the **BreakHis400x Image Dataset**, this project aims to classify breast tumor images and predict malignancy based on cell nuclei characteristics.

## Project Overview 

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women globally, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. This project is designed to develop and evaluate machine learning models that accurately classify breast cancer images and predict malignancy using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer** and **BreaKHis 400X** datasets.

By analyzing the visual characteristics of cell structures and applying deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance early detection capabilities and support medical diagnosis.

## Project Highlights

- **Multi-Model Approach**: Various machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks on the Wisconsin dataset have been evaluated and compared to obtain the best performing model.
- **Deep Learning with DenseNet**: The DenseNet CNN architecture has been used for classifying images from the BreakHis400x dataset as benign or malignant.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Detailed Exploratory data analysis on the Wisconsin Dataset has been performed as shown below:
