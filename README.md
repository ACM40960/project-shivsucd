## Project Overview 

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women globally, making early detection crucial for effective treatment. This project is designed to develop and evaluate machine learning models that accurately classify breast cancer images and predict malignancy using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer** and **BreaKHis 400X** datasets.

By analyzing the visual characteristics of cell structures and applying deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance early detection capabilities and support medical diagnosis.

## Project Highlights

- **Multi-Model Approach**: Various machine learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks on the Wisconsin dataset have been evaluated and compared to obtain the best performing model.
- **Deep Learning with DenseNet**: The DenseNet CNN architecture has been used for classifying images from the BreakHis400x dataset as benign or malignant.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Detailed Exploratory data analysis on the Wisconsin Dataset has been performed as shown below:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Detailed Exploratory data analysis on the BreaHis400x Dataset has been performed as shown below:

  </p>

- **Data Augmentation** : As observed in the above picture, the benign class is heavily imbalanced, which could create a bias in training of the images towards malignancy. In an effort to avoid this, data augmentation is peformed on the benign images by flipping and rotating the benign images existing, and increase the number of images to ensure that the augmented images can aid in better classification. The dataset after the balancing of the dataset is as follows:

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and deep learning models in accurately predicting breast cancer. The DenseNet-based CNN achieved a commendable training accuracy of 96.4% on the BreaKHis dataset, and the Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model on the Wisconsin dataset with an accuracy of 96.49%. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced algorithms in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases, providing valuable support in medical diagnosis. 

However, the variability in model performance across different datasets emphasizes the importance of dataset-specific model selection and further model refinement for clinical applications.

Future work could focus on integrating more diverse datasets and exploring ensemble methods to enhance model robustness and generalization.
